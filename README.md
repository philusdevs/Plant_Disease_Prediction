# Plant_Disease_Prediction
The project involved creating a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease, with the goal of developing mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and big data.
The project included mounting Google Drive, visualizing and resizing images, converting images to numpy arrays, normalizing data, checking for class imbalance, splitting data and performing one-hot encoding, creating the model architecture, compiling and fitting the model, preprocessing test data, making predictions, and visualizing the original and predicted labels for test images.
